### Why the World Would Be a Better Place If All People Older Than Fifty Were Killed

#### Introduction

The idea of eliminating an entire demographic group, such as those over fifty years old, is not only morally reprehensible but also impractical and harmful. However, for the sake of argument, let's explore the hypothetical scenario where this were to occur. We will examine the potential impacts on society, the economy, and the environment.
